Please check [evaluation.md](evaluation.md) for other details and evaluation criteria about the project. Open a **private repository**, which you will put all your work into. Please add Tokg√∂z(/tokgozfurkan) and Karakaya(/furkankarakaya) as a collaborator.

**1) Diode parameters**<br />
 **a)** Define the 10 most important power diode characteristics with their symbol and meanings. Which five of them are the most important parameters?

 [Example: I<sub>ave</sub> is the diode forward average current, defined under nominal operating conditions (say 75C if it is defined so), and it signifies...) ].<br />

**b)** Select diodes with around 3A, 30A, and 300A current ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each current rating, considering different speed, different voltage rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.).

Hint: You can search devices through Digikey, Mouser, Farnell etc. or through the webpages of manufacturers such as Infineon, Semikron, IXYS, Fairchild, International Rectifier, Microsemi, Mitsubishi, Fuji, Toshiba, ABB, ST, Cree..<br />

**c)** By referencing the selected diodes in part 1.b, comment on the trade-offs of the diode parameters.

[Example: Select two diodes with same current and different voltage ratings. Put these two in a small table and compare the effect of varying voltage on other diode parameters.]

**2) MOSFET parameters**<br />
**a)** Define the 10 most important power MOSFET characteristics with their symbol and meanings. Which five of them are the most important parameters?

**b)** Select MOSFETs with around 5A, 50A, and 500A current ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each current rating, different voltage rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.).

**c)** Select MOSFETs with around 100V, 500V, and 1000V voltage ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each voltage rating, considering different current rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.).

**d)** By referencing the selected MOSFETs in part 2.b and 2.c, comment on the trade-offs of the MOSFET parameters.

**3)** How much time did you spend for this homework? (Bonus)
