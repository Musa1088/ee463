Please check [evaluation.md](evaluation.md) for other details and evaluation criteria about the project. Open a **private repository**, which you will put all your work into. Please add [me](https://github.com/tokgozfurkan) as a collaborator.

**1) Diode parameters**<br />
 **a)** Define the 10 important power diode characteristics with their symbol and meanings. Which five of them are the most important parameters?

 [Example: I<sub>ave</sub> is the diode forward average current, defined under nominal operating conditions (say 75C if it is defined so), and it signifies...) ].<br />

**b)** Select diodes with around 1A, 10A, and 100A current ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each current rating, considering different speed, different voltage rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.). Put them into a table to compare the change in most important parameters.

Hint: You can search devices through Digikey, Mouser, Farnell etc. or through the webpages of manufacturers such as Infineon, Semikron, IXYS, Fairchild, International Rectifier, Microsemi, Mitsubishi, Fuji, Toshiba, ABB, ST, Cree...<br />

**c)** Select diodes with around 5V, 50V, and 500V voltage ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each voltage rating, considering different speed, different current rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.). Put them into a table to compare the change in most important parameters.

**d)** By referencing the selected diodes in part b and c, comment on the trade-offs of the diode parameters in detail. How does other parameters change when voltage and current ratings are increased? What may be the advantages and/or disadvantages of choosing an overdesign diode -for example, choosing a diode with 100A current rating to a design with a 10A current? Explain in detail.

[Example: Select two diodes with same voltage and different current ratings. Put these two in a small table and compare the effect of varying voltage on other diode parameters.]

**2) MOSFET parameters**<br />

**a)** Define the 10 most important power MOSFET characteristics with their symbol and meanings. Which five of them are the most important parameters?

**b)** Select MOSFETs with around 1A, 10A, and 100A current ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each current rating, different voltage rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.). Put them into a table to compare the change in most important parameters.

**c)** Select MOSFETs with around 5V, 50V, and 500V voltage ratings. (at most 5 different types/samples for each voltage rating, considering different current rating, different material type, i.e., Si, SiC, etc.). Put them into a table to compare the change in most important parameters.

**d)** By referencing the selected MOSFETs in part 2.b and 2.c, comment on the trade-offs of the MOSFET parameters. How does other parameters change when voltage and current ratings are increased? What may be the advantages and/or disadvantages of choosing an overdesign MOSFET? Explain in detail.
